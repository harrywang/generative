# About
This repo includes my curated (and annotated) code for generative art from different sources - many thanks to the authors for open-sourcing their works.

I often revise the code and add more comments (in README and inline) according to my own understanding. 

See each folder for details.

# Setup

setup one virtual environment and install requirements from each sub folder:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r axidraw-python/requirements.txt
pip install -r generativehut/gen-art-python/requirements.txt
```
