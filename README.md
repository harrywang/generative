# About
This repo includes my curated (and annotated) code for generative art from different sources - many thanks to the authors for open-sourcing their works.

I often revise the code and add more comments (in README and inline) according to my own understanding. 

See each folder for details:

- Generative Design Book: https://github.com/generative-design/Code-Package-p5.js
- Code for https://generated.space/ at https://github.com/kgolid/p5ycho


# Python Code

You can setup and run the python code and notebook as follows:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
run `jupyterlab' to check out the notebook

for audio, you need to `brew install ffmpeg`
